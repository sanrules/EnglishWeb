                <p>
                    Sandra, born in Madrid. Spending her first 13 years there, destiny wanted her in Avila, so she moved. There, she finished
                    high school, and despite studying the technological branch of high school, she decided to start a non
                    technological degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She found she liked english on her first trip abroad: a week long student exchange in London. Since then, all she wanted
                    was going back to the UK.
                    <br> She went back in 2010 thanks to a scholarship. She spent a month in Exmouth, a town located in the south
                    of England, about 50 minutes far from Exeter by the 57 bus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She studied Education at the University of Salamanca, and she went back to England, this time to Sheffield.
                    <br> On her 3rd year, she chose English as speciality. It made the whole degree experience change to better,
                    thanks to teachers like Mr. Fernando Beltrán.
                    <br> With the Final thesis still in progress, she decided Avila was too cold and small, and she moved again
                    to Madrid. No habiendo terminado aún el TFG, decidió que Ávila se le quedaba frío y pequeño, y se fue
                </p>
                <p>
                    She found a job in something she liked: mobile phone repair, and it allowed her to travel. She moved from Madrid to Rivas,
                    where she's still living.
                    <br> In 6 moths time, she went to Italy, Morocco, Germany, France and Poland. A year later, she went back
                    to England, this time, she visited London (3rd time) and Brighton, town she fell in love with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not everything is travelling, so in 2017 she started the WebDev course. There where two options: to love it or to hate it.
                    And she seems to have chosen the first one.
                    <br> Studying are not an impediment for travelling, but this time throughout Spain, visiting cities as Alicante,
                    Pamplona, Girona, Coruña, Pontevedra, Lugo or Almeria, that join the long list of spanish visited cities.

            <br> Thank you for reading this far. In exchange for your time, here is a joke: Why are mountains so funny? Because
            they're hill areas.
            <br> And a picture of my cats, who had collaborated so hard making this site, sleeping on my keyboard and playing
            with my mouse cord. Nothing would be possible without them...
